# TRACTIAN CHALLENGER

This repository contains the source code for the tractian challenge, designed to visualize assets and locations in a tree structure, allowing users to filter and manage data efficiently.

In this video, you will see the app opening for each company and selecting a filter.

## Possible Improvements

If I had more time, I would improve the following points:

- Further refine the interaction between the user interface and background processes to improve performance for users with large data sets.
- Add unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- I would implement pagination when loading assets and locations so that data is loaded piecemeal, causing the performance impact when dealing with large volumes of information.
- Improve animations and transitions between node expansions for a smoother, more visually appealing experience.
